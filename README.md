## Introduction
Directly mapping complex problems ($x$) to their final solutions ($y$) poses a significant challenge, often requiring an intermediate reasoning step—a latent variable ($z$)—to bridge the gap. However, explicit supervision for these intermediate thoughts is rarely available. 
Instead of relying on ground-truth reasoning labels, our approach leverages the model's confidence in the final answer ($y$) as an intrinsic reward signal.   
Through this approach, the model learns to autonomously generate the most effective intermediate steps ($z$) that maximize downstream solvability. 
           

This is our official implementation of ReSCORE: Label-free Iterative Retriever Training for Multi-hop Question Answering with Relevance-Consistency Supervision! 

![Figure](assets/figure.png)
Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires reasoning across multiple documents, making dense retriever training challenging due to query variability. We propose ReSCORE, a method that trains dense retrievers without labeled data by leveraging LLMs to assess document relevance and consistency with answers.

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need permission to access the [Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) model, or you can modify the [Script](/source/module/generate/llama.py) to use your own LLM.

We conducted all experiments using Python 3.10.12 on an NVIDIA A100 HBM2 40GB PCIe GPU, and the environments are listed in [Packages](./my_packages.txt), so please refer to it if any issues arise.

    abstract = "Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) involves reasoning across multiple documents to answer complex questions. Dense retrievers typically outperform sparse methods like BM25 by leveraging semantic embeddings in many tasks; however, they require labeled query-document pairs for fine-tuning, which poses a significant challenge in MHQA due to the complexity of the reasoning steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Retriever Supervision with Consistency and Relevance (ReSCORE), a novel method for training dense retrievers for MHQA without the need for labeled documents. ReSCORE leverages large language models to measure document-question relevance with answer consistency and utilizes this information to train a retriever within an iterative question-answering framework. Evaluated on three MHQA benchmarks, our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSCORE, with significant improvements in retrieval performance that consequently lead to state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1 scores for MHQA."
